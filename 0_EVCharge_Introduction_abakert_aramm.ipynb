    "In the next decade, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on our roads will likely rise substantially, and we believe the bulk of the charging of these vehicles will take place at home. But charging away from home or a workplace will also be key to support EV growth. Such on-the-go charge-ups will also need to be as easy and convenient as refueling a traditional, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle today. \n",
    "\n",
    "While EVs account for less than 2%* of new vehicle registrations in the US, and much less than 1%* of all vehicles on the road today, the underlying economics of EV ownership are improving. State and federal regulators are incentivizing adoption, signaling that EV penetration will likely increase steadily over the next decade and beyond. California—often a bellwether for other states—has moved to ban new ICE cars from 2035. We expect that, by then, EV ownership will be economically viable for most people.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Are we ready for EV future? Well, While EV registrations are growing at a near exponential rate in NY, the charging infrastructure does not adequately supply this demand. The ranges of EVs are increasing greatly, but the availability and speed of charging has not kept up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The NY state has provided a $4,000 tax credit to businesses to install new chargers. Additionally, New York City has begun installing curbside public stations to meet the demand. This motivated us to seek to identify gaps in this infrastructure and propose specific sites for development to fill these gaps. \n",

We have used only US charging stations as our scope is to explore gaps in New York charging station infrastructure. We have multiple secondary datasets, New York vehicle registrations, US Zip and County Shape files. All of them contain geometrical data elements. The volume of the NY Vehicle registration dataset is huge (1.5GB) and we have filtered the dataset to get only Electric and Conventional passenger vehicles. So, we have used Spark to handle the volume and split-apply-combine technique is most of our data manipulation and data exploration.\n",

    "In order to evaluate these locations based on their distance to an existing charging station and their adjusted estimated traffic counts, we created an algorithm that estimates superiority. This algorithm used the data frame as well as evaluation columns as inputs, then determined to how many other locations each location was superior. A location was superior to another location if it had greater distance from a charging station and greater adjusted traffic. Using this information we created a variable, percent superior, that estimated the percent of other locations to which each location was superior. We sorted in descending order based on this metric and selected the top 10 locations. We then used reverse geocoding to find the address of each location based on their latitude and longitude. Our chosen locations are shown in the table above. Some of the locations were repetitive as they are close to each other. However, some businesses may be more willing to install charging stations than others.\n"
